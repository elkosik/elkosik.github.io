<span style="font-family:Avenir"> I am a [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html) PhD student in [Dr. Brad Voytek's lab](https://voyteklab.com/) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). </span>

<span style="font-family:Avenir"> My graduate research is focused on interactions between the autonomic and central nervous systems. Basically, how do respiratory and cardiac rhythms influence the brain and cognition? </span>

<span style="font-family:Avenir"> By using electrophysiological neural data of all kinds (EEG, intracranial EEG, Neuropixels, etc.) my goals are to carefully quantify these neural, respiratory, and cardiac rhythms to gain a fuller understanding of brain-body relationships. </span>
