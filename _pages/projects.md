# Graduate Research

**Research Question**: Does the shape of breathing correlate with the shape of subcortical neural oscillations?

- In collaboration with [Dr. Christina Zelano](https://sites.northwestern.edu/zelano/), we are using human intracranial data to investigate the relationship between nasal respiration shape and neural oscillation shape.
- Given what we know about respiration-entrained rhythms in the brain, we hypothesize that the waveform shape of breathing may be influencing the neural oscillatory waveform shape. 
- This has deeper implications regarding the underlying neural mechanisms of waveform shape and how much of a role respiration has on cognition.

**Research Question** With more careful parameterization of the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform, what can we learn about the relationship between the heart and cognition?
