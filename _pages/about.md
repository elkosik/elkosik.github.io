## <strong> A lil' about me:</strong>

- Born in <strong>Belmont</strong>, MA. Raised in <strong>Santa Barbara</strong>, CA.
- Attended <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> (2013-2017), go bears! üêª 
- Lived in <strong>San Francisco</strong> for the next ~3 years working as a Clinical Research Coordinator at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](https://memory.ucsf.edu/). 
  - SF will always have a special place in my heart. Reach out if you need dumpling recs or hidden gems of Golden Gate Park.
- Moved to <strong>San Diego</strong> in the heart of the pandemic (summer 2020) to start graduate school at [UCSD](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html).
- Now, living in San Diego has been a dream! I love running, camping, beach days, and all things outdoors in the sunshine.
